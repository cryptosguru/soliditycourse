# Webpack Truffle Demo

From http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/building-testing-frontend-app-truffle-3

Launch an Ethereum client, like TestRPC, RPC entry point at http://127.0.0.1:8545. If you need to change the address
edit the file `app\javascripts\app.js`.

Run
```
truffle compile
truffle deploy
npm run build
npm run dev
```

In Windows you must use `truffle.cmd` instead of `truffle`

It was tested using Truffle v3.4.9, installed globally:

```
npm install -g truffle@3.4.9
```
